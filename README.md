# Cataloger (React + TypeScript)

A small demo app to practice type-safety, generics, and a simple repository pattern.  
Data comes either from static seeds (stored in localStorage) or remote APIs.  
Includes a generic searchable/sortable table and a minimal UI.

## Scripts
- `npm run dev` – start Vite dev server
- `npm run build` – production build
- `npm run preview` – preview build
- `npm run test` – run tests (if configured)

## Tech
React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind (utility classes), simple repo pattern (Remote/Storage).
